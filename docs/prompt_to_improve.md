awesome job! But I believe you can create an even more awesomely cool-looking and user-friendly interactive CLI agent that interacts with the Context7 MCP server to search for relevant documents for a given subject. Please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly to re-image a re-imagined app. Please try your very best! I have tremendous faith in your super app coding ability. Thank you and good luck!

awesome job! Please create a detailed and comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` in markdown format. Use at least 6000 words to clearly and logically describe your improved design with code snippets as examples wirh explanations. Use diagrams to show the file hierarchy with key files and their explanation. Use a mermaid diagram to show/describe the modules' interaction with each other and with the user. This document should be clear and logical, and comprehensive to serve as a source of truth to help new project members understand the codebase of the improved design quickly. Make it an awesome PAD that matches the awesomeness of your improved design. Be sure to put on your deep-thinking hat to reimagine the PAD. Thank you and good luck!

awesome job! Please use at least 3000 words to create a complete updated replacement `README.md` for the GitHub repo to host your improved design, make the README.md in markdown tags as awesome as your improved design. Next create a detailed and comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` in markdown format. Use at least 6000 words to clearly and logically describe your improved design with code snippets as examples wirh explanations. Use diagrams to show the file hierarchy with key files and their explanation. Use a mermaid diagram to show/describe the modules' interaction with each other and with the user. This document should be clear and logical, and comprehensive to serve as a source of truth to help new project members understand the codebase of the improved design quickly. Make it an awesome PAD that matches the awesomeness of your improved design. Be sure to put on your deep-thinking hat to reimagine the PAD. Thank you and good luck!

Deeply understand your role and responsibilities and share with me your understanding.

Then help me to carefully review and validate the application codebase shared in the `project_codebase_files_set.md` attached. All the files in the current project codebase are listed in the `currect_project_file_structure.txt` attached, meaning if you want to look for a file and it is not in this list, then treat it as non-existent. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase, then create for me a detailed architecture overview document in markdown and named `Project Architecture Overview Document.md`. Make sure you do a careful review and validation of the application codebase shared. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase. Use at least 6000 words for the document that accurately describes the codebase in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship. Include a section to describe the file structure and the purpose of each folder and key files, start with a diagram.

Please carefully validate any logic and coding errors that you may suspect, then use extensive web searches to validate your findings and assumptions.

awesome design! please regenerate for me all the project files again in case I miss some. put on your deep-thinking hat to carefully and systematically come up with an execution plan, then proceed with the plan to create all the project code files that are complete and drop-in replacement version. please double-check and validate each file as you generate to make sure all the files are correct and fully working. I trust your due diligence as an elite AI coding assistant. thank you and good luck!

awesome job! create a very detailed step-by-step deployment guide in markdown format for your improved design, use at least 4000 words for the deployment guide and make it very clear, logical and easy to follow by non-IT savvy person . please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and meticulously re-imagine an awesome and highly useful guide for novice, include all the necessary commands (bash scripts, for create the project file hierarchy, Dockerfile and docker compose file, etc). I trust that you will do a great due diligence as my absolutely trusted AI coding assistant. thank you and good luck!

awesome application scaffolding, but I need you to generate all the project code files to make application a complete working one.

you stopped halfway. please check whether you left off and then continue your generation from there. do proceed carefully and meticulously. my best AI coding assistant in the world!
