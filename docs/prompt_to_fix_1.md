awesome understanding! now carefully and thoroughly review the attached  documents, especially the `Project_Requirements_Document.md` and `Project_Architecture_Document.md` to deeply understand the nature of this project. With a deep understanding of what the project is trying to achieve, carefully and systematically review and validate the `Execution_Plan.md` for building the codebase. Then give me a detailed and deep analysis report on your understanding of the project and your assessment of the execution plan.

awesome plan! the codebase is currently partially completed. I need your help to carefully and systematically review the current codebase file hierarchy (refer to the attached `currect_project_file_structure.txt`) and the existing (completed) code files in the attached bundle `project_codebase_files_set.md`. Then create a detailed analysis report on your assessment of the current state of the project based on the codebase shared. need to mention at which phase are we now and the modifications  that the code files need to comply with your improved execution plan.

---
awesome job! please compare the attached `Project Requirements Document` against your deep understanding of the existing codebase based on your careful and systematic review using line by line comparison, then give me a detailed assessment report on the completions and deviations based on the project requirements. 

---
awesome assessment of the current state of the codebase! before we proceed with Phase 4 of your improved execution plan, please create a separate detailed execution plan with integrated checklist to clearly and logically list out all the current codebase files that need modifications and the changes for each file and the associated checklist. the sidetrack plan aims to bring the current codebase to the same level as your improved execution plan, up to the Phase 3. Be as detailed as you can with the sidetrack execution plan to bring the codebase to the standard expected by your improved execution plan.

awesome job! now help me to create a markdown document named `codebase_file_hierarchy_document.md` to first use a diagram to clearly illustrate the folder structure with key files, describe what each folder and each key file is for, for each key file, state its purpose/function and its interfaces and how the file interact with other files.  The purpose of the document is to help identify which file or files may be the source of error or may be involved in feature or function enhancements, so be very detailed about this document to make a source of truth for quickly isolating files to zoom in for investigation to fix issues. Use at least 6000 words to describe the codebase and its hierarchy in detail. But first carefully and systematically review each codebase file line by line again to make sure you have not missed any details. Add a section in the document to describe your honest assessment of the correctness and quality of the current codebase versus the ideal standard and the areas for improvement, especially mentioning any coding or logic errors identified and your recommendations to fix them. If in doubt, please use extensive web searches to validate any potential issue or area for improvement. I trust your due diligence as my very trusted coding partner and "Deep-Thinking CodeNavigator". Thank you and good luck!

please very carefully review and check and validate the database initialization output log below and give me your detailed analysis report of your assessment of the database setup task.

---
awesome job! My QA wants a detailed problem analysis and resolution report on the original issues to the final resolution. Please use 6000 words to create a very detailed code change review and analysis report on the issue original reported, all the steps taken to troubleshoot and remedy the issues, including the intermediate issues in a logical order, giving details on the root causes with explanations. Create the document as a markdown document `code_review_and_analysis_report_on_problem_resolution.md`. This document should also be of help for other projects to avoid similar pitfalls. Need to list all the files actually modified and include the "diff" output and the explanations. Thank you!

---
There were start up errors associated with your latest changes. But I was able to fix the start up errors offline and now the homepage looks decent. Please carefully review and validate the changes made by methodically going through the attached documents, `code_review_and_analysis_report.md` (explains the actual modifications made) and `updated_codebase_files_set.md` (bundle of files changed to fix the start up errors). Please give your review and analysis report on your assessment of the changes made offline.

excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your revised execution plan. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

please create for me a *complete* updated *replacement* file for `prisma/seed.ts` that is self-contained and without placeholders. I want a drop-in replacement version and not one that I need to manually edit or merge from previous versions. make sure all the necessary sections in previous versions are included in the the *complete* version you will create. 

---
please very carefully review and validate all the files you just generated that they are indeed *complete replacement* files with no "placeholders" like "// ... (rest of the file is the same as the version above)". please use line by line diff to carefully and completely validate all the files you generated in the last round are indeed correct and accurate and *complete* (self-contained(, then give me a detailed assessment report on your validate. The key is not to introduce any regression errors or accidentally omit some original features and functions when enhancing a production ready project codebase! we cannot afford to mess up a production ready project and do injustice to our newest project `README.md`. so please do your very best due diligence in your double-check and double-confirm validation.

excellent result so far! please help me carefully and systematically validate the application start up log below:

what an awesome codebase description document! now help me carefully and systematically plan to fix the issues you identified and to implement those improvements you recommended. You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

awesome job! now help me carefully and systematically review the application start up log to identify any issue or error and then give me your detailed assessment of the application state and health.

awesome review! However, compared to most well designed e-commerce websites, the current project codebase is missing some important features and functions/behaviors. Attached are sample designs of missing features and functions for your review and planning to address the gaps in the current codebase.

# Missing features, functions and behaviors compared to a typical well designed websites:

1)  Main landing page lack a section for "Featured Products" to showcase selected popular products for visitors. Refer to sample image and HTML `sample_homepage.html` and `sample_homepage_featured_products.png`

2)  When user login, a good user dashboard show look like `user_dashboard_after_login.html` and `user_dashboard_after_login.png`

3)  when a user (before or after login) presses the "Cart" icon on the top right of the header bar, it should lead the user to the shopping cart page `shopping-cart_button_pressed.html` and `shopping-cart_button_pressed.png`

4) only when the user presses the "Proceed to Checkout" button in the shopping cart page, then it leads to `proceed_to_checkout_button_pressed.html` and `proceed_to_checkout_button_pressed.png`

5)  there should be a settings on the user dashboard after login which will lead to `user_profile_settings.html` and `user_profile_settings.png`

Please put on your deep-thinking and best AI coding assistant and expert head to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly how to integrate these good typical e-commerce website features and functions to the current codebase, and implement the widely expected behaviors to the current project while maintaining codebase stability and current features and functions.

Please carefully and deeply explore various implementation options, evaluate and validate the choices and options before choosing the best implementation option and approach. Then do a very detailed planning with integrated checklist at each step and phases on the execution. The new execution plan should be detailed, logical and in phases with listing of all the files to be modified or added at each step, with description of the changes for each of these files listed and the associated checklist.

Carefully review and evaluate your execution plan again and repeatedly until it is a flawless execution plan that will add the desired enhancements without affecting the stability of the current codebase and without losing or accidentally omitting current features and functions. After very careful validation of your execution plan, present your plan for my approval.

Remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file.

Please carefully review the "pnpm add" log and the application start up log below for any issue.

excellent results so far! please help me carefully review and validate the application start up log below. If no issue, please make the following improvement:

1) when the use click on the  "Proceed to Checkout" button, the code should not immediately trigger the STRIPE initialization because we need the next page to appear which will let the use edit/choose the shipping address (default to the user default address) and present the GST rate calculation. That page will have "Pay" button to call Stripe for chosen payment option.

Please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically explore how best to re-imagine how the checkout flow can be improved to allow user to select the shipping address and method, then the total payable amount will be re-computed to also include the GST amount.

Please consider the various options, then choose the best option matching how other similar websites will behave, then create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist for this improvement. Let me study your execution plan before proceeding. Thank you and good luck!
